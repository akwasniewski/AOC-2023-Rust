# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles written in Rust.

## Requirements

- Rust (stable)
- Cargo (stable)

## Usage
For ease of use I have modified all the inputs so that the first line contains one integer, signifying input length in lines or, if each input chunk is multiline, number of input chunks. \
Problems are organized by days, and as each problem has two parts by problem part.\
To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and run:

```sh
cargo run <../in.in
```
